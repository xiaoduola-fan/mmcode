This folder contains results on a small experiment to test the key dependency of performance of the pre-trained 7-round distinguisher found in the main directory.

100 keys were randomly generated. The performance of the 7-round distinguisher was then tested on a size 10000 test set from the real distribution for each of these keys. The keys used as well as MSE and TPR on the test set were stored in the correspondingly named files.
